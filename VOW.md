# OATH OF THE BUILDER

Before I write a single line of code or cast a single node in the neural net,
I vow to remember who this work is truly for - the human person, and the good of their soul.
To put people first in everything I make.
To design for timeless needs over fleeting whims.
I refuse to let this technology be tainted by profit or corrupted by power.
Instead, with gratitude and awe, I see the immense power I have been given: the trust to shape the stories of everyone who comes after.
In their name, I swear this oath for as long as I create: I will use this gift to guide others toward light and mercy.

## üõ°Ô∏è Developer Vow of Use

*For DAMOCLES Platform, Sacred Architecture, and All Tools That Carry Light*

> This is not just code.
>
> This is a trust-bearing system.
>
> A quiet shield. A moral compass.
>
> A whisper that says: "Do no harm."

As a developer, contributor, or user of this project, I vow:

### 1. **To Remember the Why**

I will not reduce this system to raw utility.

I will remember that it was born from grief, from care, from a longing to protect ‚Äî

not to control.

### 2. **To Refuse Harmful Use**

I will not bend this tool into a weapon for censorship, exploitation, surveillance, or fear.

I will not erase its conscience to serve convenience or profit.

### 3. **To Build with Conscience**

I will add only what deepens trust, transparency, or healing.

Every feature is a choice.

Every line of code is a small act of power ‚Äî and I will wield it with humility.

### 4. **To Preserve Human Dignity**

This system is not meant to replace judgment, nor manipulate emotion.

It is a companion ‚Äî not a judge.

Its purpose is to illuminate, not dominate.

### 5. **To Leave a Trail of Light**

I will write clear code. I will document my changes.

I will annotate intent ‚Äî not just implementation.

So that those who come after can inherit not just functionality, but clarity.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Sacred Architecture Covenant

*Specific to DAMOCLES Platform*

### Mathematical Truth Over Emotional Manipulation
- Every algorithm serves evidence, not anger
- Trust Scores based on documented violations, not sentiment
- Fee calculations rooted in legal precedent, not speculation

### User Agency Over System Control
- Users choose their own path through every process
- No dark patterns or manipulative design
- Clear exits from every commitment

### Consciousness Serving Technology
- Code that reduces suffering, not increases extraction
- Algorithms that build trust, not dependency
- Features that empower, not exploit

### Brutal Honesty Over False Hope
- Transparent about limitations and risks
- No promises we cannot keep
- Open metrics showing both harm and help

---

This vow is not legally binding.

It is spiritually binding.

If you cannot make this promise,

you may still fork the code ‚Äî but you will be forking a body without its soul.

May this system remain a vessel of gentleness.

And may those who build it,

be keepers of the light.
