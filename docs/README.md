# 📚 DAMOCLES Documentation Index

Welcome to the DAMOCLES platform documentation - where accountability meets technology, without the extraction.

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

### [📜 Manifesto](MANIFESTO.md)
**START HERE** - Our ethical foundation: Technology as accountability, not extraction. Understanding why we reject speculation in favor of genuine service.

## 🏗️ **Technical Documentation**

### [🏛️ Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
Complete system architecture including Sacred Architecture Trust Engine, microservices design, and deployment infrastructure.

### [📖 API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
Comprehensive API reference for all services:
- 🧠 Trust Engine (port 8002) - Mathematical trust analysis
- 👤 User Service (port 3000) - Authentication & debt management
- 🤖 GDPR Engine (port 8001) - Norwegian legal automation

### [🗺️ Development Roadmap](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
Current status (95% complete), completed features, and remaining tasks for Beta launch.

### [🚀 Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
Step-by-step instructions for launching the platform on DigitalOcean, AWS, or other cloud providers.

## 🔧 **Implementation Guides**

### Trust Engine Implementation
Mathematical trust scoring using Norwegian Authority Hierarchy:
- **Formula:** `TrustScore = Σ(Authority_Weight × Authority_Score × Cross_Vector_Confidence) - Σ(Contradiction_Penalty × Authority_Differential)`
- **Authority Range:** Høyesterett (1.0) → Social Media (0.05)
- **Contradiction Types:** 6 categories including settlement logic, data contradictions

### Sacred Architecture Principles
- **Kindness Algorithm:** Consciousness-serving user interactions
- **Service Detection:** Mathematical classification of extraction vs service behaviors
- **User Agency:** Preserved through dismissible interactions and alternatives

## 🛡️ **Legal & Compliance**

### Norwegian GDPR Compliance
- Automated request generation for debt collectors
- Template system for banks, BNPL, and inkasso companies
- Violation detection and evidence collection

### Consumer Protection Framework
- Evidence-based legal challenge support
- Collective action coordination without exploitation
- Transparent fee structure (service fees, not speculation)

## 🗡️ **Sacred Architecture Components**

### Mathematical Trust Analysis
```
🧮 Core Equation: Kindness × Scale × Time = Universal Flourishing
⚔️ Anti-Pattern: Hype × FOMO × Greed = Founder Enrichment
```

### SWORD Token Distribution (5% Founder, 95% Users/Builders)
- 25% Evidence Mining Rewards (Users)
- 20% Developer Incentives & Bounties
- 15% Settlement Treasury
- 12% Legal War Chest
- 10% Staking Rewards Pool
- 8% Development Team (2-year vest)
- 5% Founder Allocation
- 3% Community Airdrops
- 2% Liquidity Pools

## 🌟 **Core Values in Documentation**

Every document reflects our commitment to:
- **Transparency over opacity** - All operations documented
- **Evidence over promises** - Mathematical proofs, not marketing
- **Service over extraction** - Tools that help, not exploit
- **Honesty about limitations** - Clear about what we can/cannot do

## 🔍 **Finding What You Need**

- **New to DAMOCLES?** Start with [Manifesto](MANIFESTO.md)
- **Want to deploy?** Go to [Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- **Building features?** Check [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [API docs](API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- **Understanding progress?** Review [Development Roadmap](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
- **Facing debt collection?** Platform automates GDPR requests and provides trust analysis

## 💎 **Sacred Architecture Promise**

> *"Every algorithm is a chance to serve consciousness.  
> Every calculation is an opportunity for kindness.  
> Every analysis brings us closer to justice."*

This isn't philosophy - it's implemented code that empowers users, provides mathematical analysis, and coordinates ethical collective action.
