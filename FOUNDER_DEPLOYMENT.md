**Allocation:** 50,000,000 SWORD tokens (5% of total supply)

**Justification:** As the creator of the DAMOCLES protocol, you deserve founder allocation following industry standards (Bitcoin's Satoshi, Ethereum's Vitalik, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Fund Your Wallet

**Testnet (Recommended for testing):**
```bash
# Visit the Cardano testnet faucet
https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/

# Your address (copy this):
addr1qxa0qatlwqfykwslhteprxvz2thrf709w76lk62442725wynzamj4crwpt3yrc8xuyx8cadzs0vz93fdgl05806ygnmq5q8rcy

# Request 1000 ADA (you only need ~5 for deployment)
```

**Mainnet (Real deployment):**
- Buy ADA from exchange (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
- Send at least 5 ADA to your address
- ⚠️ **WARNING: Mainnet uses real money!**

### 2. Run Founder Setup

```bash

./scripts/setup-founder.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check your wallet balance
- ✅ Build smart contracts  
- ✅ Deploy genesis minting
- ✅ Mint 50M tokens to your address
- ✅ Verify successful deployment

### 3. Verify Your Tokens

```bash
# Check your token balance
python3 scripts/verify-founder-tokens.py testnet

# Or for mainnet
python3 scripts/verify-founder-tokens.py mainnet
```

### 4. Access Founder Dashboard

```bash
# Start the development environment
make dev

# Visit your founder dashboard
http://localhost:3001/founder
```

## Manual Deployment (If Needed)

### Step 1: Check Wallet Balance

    --testnet-magic 1097911063

# Mainnet  
cardano-cli query utxo \
    --address addr1qxa0qatlwqfykwslhteprxvz2thrf709w76lk62442725wynzamj4crwpt3yrc8xuyx8cadzs0vz93fdgl05806ygnmq5q8rcy \
    --mainnet
```

### Step 2: Build Smart Contracts

```bash
cd smart-contracts/plutus
cabal build damocles-contracts
```

### Step 3: Deploy Founder Tokens

```bash
cd smart-contracts
./scripts/deploy-founder-tokens.sh testnet

# Or for mainnet (BE CAREFUL!)

## Governance Powers

### Standard User vs. Founder

| Feature | Standard User | Founder |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Voting Weight | 1x token amount | 5x token amount |
| Proposal Creation | 1M token threshold | No threshold |
| Veto Rights | None | Full veto power |
| Emergency Powers | None | Platform protection |
| Board Equivalent | None | Permanent board seat |

### Governance Responsibilities

As founder, you have the power and responsibility to:
- Guide platform development
- Protect user interests
- Prevent harmful proposals
- Maintain platform integrity
- Lead by example

## Security Best Practices

### Wallet Management

```bash
# Create multiple wallets for security
# Hot wallet: 10% (daily operations)
# Cold storage 1: 40% (hardware wallet)  
# Cold storage 2: 40% (backup hardware wallet)
# Staking wallet: 10% (locked in contracts)
```

### Risk Management

- Never share private keys
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Diversify across multiple addresses
- Regular security audits
- Cold storage for majority of tokens

## Tax Considerations (Norway)

### Token Classification

- **Utility Tokens:** SWORD tokens likely classified as crypto assets
- **Tax Rate:** 22% capital gains on sales
- **Staking Income:** Taxable as income when received
- **Company Structure:** Consider AS (corporation) for tax optimization

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Hold Through Company:** 22% corporate vs 47.4% personal rate
2. **Strategic Timing:** Control when to realize gains
3. **Staking Through Entity:** Business income treatment
4. **Professional Advice:** Consult Norwegian crypto tax expert

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient funds" error:**
- Need at least 5 ADA for transaction fees
- Check wallet balance with cardano-cli

**"UTxO not found" error:**
- Wallet address not funded
- Wrong network (testnet vs mainnet)

**Smart contract build fails:**
