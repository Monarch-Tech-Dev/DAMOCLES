# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on consumer protection and economic justice.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other community members
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the community
* **Supporting consumer rights** and fair treatment in all interactions
* **Maintaining professional discourse** about financial services and legal matters
* **Sharing knowledge** to help others understand consumer protection

* **Public or private harassment** of any form
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

* **Legal advice** beyond general consumer rights information
* **Encouraging illegal activities** or unethical behavior toward financial institutions
* **Sharing personal debt details** without proper privacy considerations
* **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate** in a professional setting

## Consumer Protection Focus

As a consumer protection platform, we maintain additional standards:

### Constructive Engagement
* Focus on **systemic issues** rather than personal attacks on individuals
* **Verify information** before sharing claims about financial institutions
* **Respect privacy** when discussing debt or financial situations
* **Support evidence-based** approaches to consumer protection

### Professional Conduct
* Distinguish between **platform capabilities** and legal advice
* Acknowledge **limitations** of automated tools
* Promote **responsible use** of GDPR and legal processes
* Maintain **transparency** about platform operations

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
* All project repositories and related services
* Community forums and discussions
* Issue reports and pull requests
* Public presentations about DAMOCLES
* Social media interactions related to the project

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* **Email**: conduct@damocles.no
* **Secure contact**: For sensitive reports involving security or privacy
* **Anonymous reporting**: Available through our community channels

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal by contacting conduct@damocles.no with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original enforcement action.

## Special Considerations

### Consumer Protection Context

Given our focus on consumer protection and financial transparency:

* **Respect institutional critique** while maintaining professional standards
* **Distinguish between individual and systemic issues**
* **Maintain factual accuracy** when discussing financial institutions
* **Protect user privacy** when sharing experiences or case studies

### Legal and Financial Discussions

* **We provide tools, not advice** - make this distinction clear
* **Respect regulatory boundaries** in different jurisdictions
* **Support evidence-based advocacy** for consumer rights
* **Maintain transparency** about platform limitations and capabilities
